# Classifying spam

## Description

Use the Spambase dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to classify spam. This data is already parsed down from email to features.


## Objectives

* Create a Bayesian classifier
* Train the classifier
* Test the classifier


Subsample the data set so 60% is training data and 40% is test data.  (The original is about 60% not-spam and 40% spam.)

Write code to classify the data into spam and not-spam, training with your training data and testing on your test data.

## Hard Mode
##### (not yet attempted)

In addition to the normal mode requirements, try reducing or changing features in order to get better results.

Find another source of spam/not-spam data, break it down into features, and perform the same exercise as above. How well does your algorithm perform on the new data?
